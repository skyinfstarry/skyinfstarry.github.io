## 🛠 Tech stack

- **[Phaser 3](https://phaser.io/)** — primary 2D game engine (~90% of games).
- **[Three.js](https://threejs.org/)** — for the 3D titles.
- **Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS** — for the landing page launcher. No bundler, no React, no framework.
- **Static-only** — deploys to GitHub Pages with zero config.

Each individual game lives in its own folder with `index.html`, `assets/`, and (usually) a `config.json` and `mechanics.js`. Games are self-contained and use only **relative paths** internally, so they'll keep working even if you copy a folder elsewhere.

---

## 🧩 Adding a new game

1. Drop your game folder into the right category, e.g. `games/puzzle/my-cool-puzzle/`. Make sure it has its own `index.html`.
2. Add an entry to [`games/registry.json`](games/registry.json):
   ```json
   {
     "slug": "my-cool-puzzle",
     "name": "My Cool Puzzle",
     "category": "puzzle",
     "path": "games/puzzle/my-cool-puzzle/index.html",
     "tech": "phaser",
     "tags": ["logic", "tiles"],
     "description": "One-line pitch shown on the card."
   }
   ```
3. (Optional) Add an emoji override in [`site/app.js`](site/app.js) `GAME_EMOJI`.
4. Open a PR. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full checklist.
